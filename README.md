# Team 10 HW5
To get started, you'll need to create a folder named `data` and place each teams transaction list from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b1hTFS614imW46084Ay_L3ub34SXOM2C into it.

It must look exactly like this:
```
jason@carbon:~/rowan/cs02620/hw5$ tree
.
├── data
│   ├── team10.db
│   ├── team11.txt
│   └── team12.csv
└── hw5_team10.ipynb

1 directory, 4 files

```
